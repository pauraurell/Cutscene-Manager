# What is a cutscene?

By definition, a cutscene is a not interactive sequence in a video game that breaks up the gameplay. Cutscenes are used to show conversations between characters, set the mood, reward the player, introduce new gameplay elements, show the effects of a player's actions... Although the definition says that cutscenes are not interactive, nowadays we see a lot of videogames with quick time events which basically are cutscenes where the player has to press buttons to continue the scene. 

# Types of cutscene

We can divide cutscenes in three types: Pre-rendered, Real time and Live-action cutscenes.

### Live-action cutscenes

This type of cutscenes are the less common nowadays and they are basicaly videos recorded in the real live with actors, the same as films. Back at the days these cutscenes were the best way of explaining the story of a game and were a great innovation but nowadays it's really rare to find one of this type in a video game.

### Pre-rendered cutscenes

This type of cutscenes are scenes that are already loaded and rendered when the player is seeing them. They can be made with the game engine or, the most common way, with external software. 

### Real time cutscenes

In the real time cutscenes, what the player sees is being rendered in that moment and obviously these type of cutscenes are made with the game engine.
