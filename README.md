# What is a cutscene?

By definition, a cutscene is a not interactive sequence in a video game that breaks up the gameplay. Cutscenes are used to show conversations between characters, set the mood, reward the player, introduce new gameplay elements, show the effects of a player's actions... Although the definition says that cutscenes are not interactive, nowadays we see a lot of videogames with quick time events which basically are cutscenes where the player has to press buttons to continue the scene. 

# Types of cutscene

We can divide cutscenes in three types: Pre-rendered, Real time and Live-action cutscenes.
